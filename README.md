Tech challenge for Udaan.com

Use udaan__nam.cpp
(double underscore)
I have implemented the system using C++. 
From library.txt file I have first imported the library data into a 3D array and have performed operations on it. The librarian is first asked to choose the way he wants to search- through book name or author. According to the choice made, the book/author name is entered. The issue[] array is used as follow: 1 if book is issued,0 if its still available. With the help of issue[] we search the book and its status. If its available, we ask for student id and date and store it in st[] array thats displayed at the end.

Thus, by doing so, a book's status with book id, student id and return date is stored.
